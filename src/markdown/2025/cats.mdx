## 2025 Cats Review

[1] Home: To alleviate the poor posture from constantly having Scoop in her lap, we attached a cat bed to Madison’s desk. Bluebell suddenly took an interest in being in her office, too, and claimed the bed. With no room to add another bed, Scoop remains a lap cat.

[2] Indiana: Scoop turned out to be a big fan of Aunt Linda’s Longaberger baskets.

[3] Indiana: While visiting in January, if we couldn’t find them, they were probably inspecting Grandma’s new bidet.

[4] Indiana: Scoop deciding that Sam is okay afterall.

[5] Home: Whenever the cryocuff machine for surgery recovery was opened for an ice refill, both cats thought it was their personal drinking fountain. Bluebell also started grooming Madison’s hair incessantly within hours of getting home from surgery.

[6] Home: With stairs (and her second-floor office) off-limits, the couch became Madison’s workspace for six months. The cats transitioned from lap-sitting to chest-sitting.

[7] Home: Within a day of returning from Japan, Bluebell started claiming Shawn’s back as her resting spot whenever he dared to leave it open for a lie.

[8] Home: The cats are big fans of the new wood-burning stove.

[9] DEN: After 15 hours in travel bags thanks to delays, we tried to give them a chance to use their travel litter box in the family restroom. They opted to inspect the whole place instead.

[10] Indiana: Now that we’re home, they are pissed that every hour is not “treat o’clock” like at Grandma’s.

[11] Indiana: Inspecting the work of Chase’s custom cat house build. Bluebell is already inside.

[12] Indiana: Scoop flopping onto a work-in-progress puzzle. They took turns doing this for days.
